# This is a collection of notes to self: 

To recompile basic example of running pdlp with input as mps file:
 - make build SOURCE=examples/cpp/pdlp_solve.cc

To run the tests, this does not matter much:
 - make run SOURCE=examples/cpp/pdlp_solve.cc

NOTE: Structs are defined in .proto files. Makes sense but not something I am used to.
